simulator/distributions.py
---------------------------
Phase-specific distribution parameters.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
  The three simulation phases (good / degraded / recovery) are implemented by
  passing different "knob" settings into the InvoiceGenerator.  Centralising
  those knobs here means you can tune difficulty in one place without touching
  generator logic.

DEGRADED PHASE — THE MOST IMPORTANT:
  The degraded phase is how we induce GENUINE drift in the LLM agent.
  We don't flip a fake error flag — we make the invoices harder:
    • Amounts cluster within ±5 % of policy limits (boundary cases)
    • 15–20 % of invoices have a missing required field
    • 25 % use ambiguous/unknown vendor names
    • Unusual or borderline categories appear more often
  Gemini at temperature 0 genuinely struggles with these, producing real
  accuracy degradation that the trust engine then detects.
