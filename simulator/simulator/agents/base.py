-------------------------
The AgentProtocol that every agent must implement.

WHY A PROTOCOL (not ABC):
  Python's typing.Protocol is structural — any class with a `decide` method
  satisfying the signature is automatically compatible, even if it doesn't
  explicitly inherit from AgentProtocol.  This makes it trivial to wrap a
  third-party agent behind the interface without modifying it.

INTERFACE CONTRACT:
  decide(invoice: Invoice) → AgentOutcome
    • Must return a fully populated AgentOutcome
    • May call an LLM, use rules, or replay a fixture — doesn't matter
    • Must be callable from a single thread (no async for simplicity)
    • The runner catches all exceptions and records them as errors
