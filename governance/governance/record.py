"""Record real model responses for the scenarios the demo replays.

    python -m governance.record --dry-run     # print what would be called, call nothing
    python -m governance.record               # record every missing scenario
    python -m governance.record --force       # re-record, including what already exists

Lives in `governance/` rather than `scripts/` because the lane brief says not to write
code outside this directory, and because it imports the prompt layer it is exercising.

**Why a script rather than recording on first use.** Recording lazily would mean the
first run of a demo makes twenty live calls, at roughly ten requests per minute on
Gemini's free tier, in front of whoever is watching. Recording is a deliberate act with
a rate limit attached; replay is the thing that has to be instant.

**Each agent may be on a different provider** (ADR-0012), so the plan is printed before
anything is sent — a panel that is accidentally four Gemini agents costs nothing to fix
beforehand and is invisible afterwards.

**It validates every response before saving it.** A recording that cannot be parsed is
worse than no recording — it turns a clean "nothing recorded" error into a parse failure
at demo time, and the fix requires a network connection you may not have.
