"""The LangGraph workflow: four agents in parallel, one aggregated Recommendation out.

LangGraph concept, stated plainly because this design has to survive a panel question:
a `StateGraph` is a directed graph whose nodes are functions over a shared state. Edges
from `START` to all four agents mean LangGraph runs them in the same superstep — they
do not see each other's opinions, which is the point. Independent opinions can
disagree; sequential ones anchor on whatever the first agent said.

All four then edge into `aggregate`, which LangGraph runs once, after every incoming
node has finished.

    START ──┬──> risk ────────┬──> aggregate ──> END
            ├──> performance ─┤
            ├──> compliance ──┤
            └──> audit ───────┘

What this graph will never contain: an edge to anything that writes. Governance
recommends, the Policy Engine enforces, a human authorizes (ADR-0001, ADR-0004).
