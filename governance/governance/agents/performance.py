"""Performance Agent — is the improvement real, or is it a small-sample artifact?

This agent exists because a point estimate lies at low sample sizes. 10 correct
decisions out of 10 reads as "100% accurate" and means almost nothing; the Wilson
lower bound on that same evidence is around 72%, and that is the number worth
reasoning about. The trust engine already computes both — this agent's job is to say
out loud which one the recommendation is actually resting on.
