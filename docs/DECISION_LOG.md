**2026-09-01 — Varun C. (PR #21 into `vc/swappable-providers`, landed on `main`
via PR #23)** — Governance cached mode now replays real Gemini responses, and
live mode is open. Fifteen recordings committed, keyed
`agent.version.model.evidence`: `healthy_increase`, `thin_sample` and
`contested_increase` complete, three of four agents on `active_drift`;
`critical_error` and `at_ceiling` unrecorded. Live mode calls the provider with
a 25s per-agent deadline and falls back **to the recording, never to stub
text**, labelling the result `live+cached` and naming the fallen-back agents in
the rationale. The retry decision reads each error's `retryable` flag rather
than matching exception types. Three defects that only the live API could
expose, found by one probe call before the recording run: the default model
`gemini-2.5-flash` returns 404 for recently-created keys (now
`gemini-3-6-flash`); the 30s recording timeout sat inside the model's own
latency spread (9.9s/15.6s/33.3s observed, now 120s); and `record.py` documented
a `.env` file that nothing in the lane ever read. Added
`RecordingStaleError` — `Recording.prompt_sha` had described itself as a
tripwire since it was written and nothing compared it, so editing a prompt in
place replayed recordings of the older wording while looking perfectly healthy.
Added a `contested_increase` scenario because the conservatism ratchet had no
scenario in which it could fire against the real model: the 27 Aug
`has_dissent=True` figure was a stub artifact. **Why:** the 30 Aug and 3 Sept
deliverables, plus the discovery that the Gemini free tier is 20 requests per
**day**, not the ~10 per minute this lane had assumed — which makes a full
re-record cost more than a working day and turns silent staleness from a
nuisance into the likely failure. **Affects:** `governance/` only; no contract,
no `shared/`, no other lane. Cached and live both still advisory — no writes, no
policy mutation, `status` always `PENDING`. Also adds `governance/INTEGRATION.md`
for VP: `RecommendationOut.model_validate(recommendation)` validates with zero
adaptation, verified, and the full chain runs in 7.4ms with no network. Two
things still needed from the backend lane — how `governance` gets installed into
its environment, and when `recommendations.py` stops serving fixtures.

---

**2026-08-30 — Varun C. (PR #16)** — LLM provider is a per-agent setting
(`GOVERNANCE_PROVIDER`, overridable per agent with
`GOVERNANCE_PROVIDER_<AGENT>`). Claude and OpenAI clients are optional extras
with lazy imports and SDK exceptions mapped by class name, so the test suite
runs with neither package installed. `build_client()` is cached **per
provider**, not per agent, so two agents on one provider share a client and
therefore share a pacer — a rate limit belongs to the key, not the agent.
Structured output needed three schema dialects, not one: Gemini takes an
OpenAPI-3.0 subset with no `$ref`, while Claude and OpenAI take strict JSON
Schema requiring every field in `required`. **Why:** a panel that asks "is this
Gemini-specific?" should get a demonstration rather than an assurance.
**Affects:** `governance/` only. **Open:** ADR-0012 is still *Proposed* and asks
the team to rule on whether optional paid providers violate the lane brief's "do
not introduce any paid service"; the strict-reading rollback (drop the two
clients, keep the seam and the registry) is written up in the ADR. #16 merged on
CI, so that ruling is now retroactive and still owed.

---

**2026-08-29 — Varun C. (PR #15)** — Gemini client, recording store, and cached
mode end to end: a recorded response is looked up by cache key and validated
through the same `parse_opinion()` a live response would face. Raw HTTP rather
than the `google-genai` SDK, so the `responseSchema`/`responseMimeType` pair
that backs this lane's constrained-decoding claim is visible in a dict rather
than hidden behind a method; the key travels in an `x-goog-api-key` header,
never the URL, because query strings reach proxy logs. The client paces on a
**floor between calls** rather than a token bucket — a bucket permits exactly
the burst the free tier punishes. Every failure path raises: a missing recording
raises rather than falling back to stub text, and an unparseable response is
refused rather than saved. **Why:** the demo default is cached mode, and a
governance path that degrades quietly produces a demo that looks healthy and
isn't — which is the failure this whole lane exists to prevent. **Affects:**
`governance/` only. `scenarios.py` imports `trust_engine.evaluate()` at dev time
to build recording inputs; it is the lane's only trust import and is not on any
runtime path.

---

**2026-08-31 — Varun P.** — Branch cleanup, own branches only (`vp/*`,
`docs/*`, `chore/*`, `shared/*`; `uk/*`/`vc/*`/`ad/*` left untouched, not this
lane's to clean up). Deleted, local and remote, 12 branches verified merged
by diffing each branch's touched files against the exact merge/squash commit
that closed its PR (ancestry alone misses squash merges): `shared/v1-1-
recommendation-and-audit-sample`, `chore/infra-baseline`, `docs/reset-and-
reschedule`, `origin/docs/system-explained-merge`, `origin/chore/rename-and-
docs`, `origin/docs/resurrect-pr5`, `origin/docs/delta-audit-27aug`,
`vp/openapi-contract`, `docs/mentor-briefing`, `docs/landscape-research`,
`docs/audit-and-risk-fix`, `vp/schema-and-policy-engine` (PR #18, merged
today). Reset `vp/backend` onto `origin/main` instead of deleting it — it had
never diverged past the 17 Aug scaffold commit still shared with `uk/trust`/
`vc/governance`/`ad/simulator-frontend`, so the fix was to stop it pointing at
dead history, not to remove the branch. **Why:** all 18 PRs to date are
merged and nothing else is open in scope; an accurate branch list matters
more once `main` is close to demo-ready. **Affects:** branch list only, no
source changes; `git branch -d` (never `-D`) and `--force-with-lease` (never
`--force`) throughout, so anything genuinely unmerged would have been
refused rather than lost.

---

**2026-08-31 — Varun P. (via `vp/schema-and-policy-engine`)** — Wrote the
Policy Engine as a pure module (`backend/app/policy/`): `evaluate_decision`
(may the agent act, or must it escalate — missing/invalid policy version
fails closed, `SUSPENDED`/`RESTRICTED` escalate regardless of amount, an
amount exactly at the limit is allowed — inclusive ceiling, documented and
tested deliberately) and `clamp_recommendation` (the hard ceiling: a
proposed limit never rises above what the trust engine's evidence supports,
and the fact of clamping is always recorded, never silent). 35 tests,
including Hypothesis property tests (never allows above the limit; allowed
implies within-limit; deterministic under arbitrary input) and an
`ast`-based import-boundary test
that fails the build if the module gains a database, network, LLM, file I/O,
`os.environ`, or wall-clock dependency (ADR-0014, enforcing ADR-0003 in code
rather than by convention). Policy Engine reason codes live in
`backend/app/policy/reason_codes.py`, not `shared/reason_codes.py` — that
file's own scope is trust-evaluation reasoning, has no codes for "why did
this one decision get allowed or escalated," and `shared/` is frozen for
this branch; see ADR-0014 for the full argument and the promotion path if
the other three owners want these moved into `shared/` later. **Why:** Sat
29 Aug deliverable (docs/DEADLINES.md) — "the single most important module
in the project," per this lane's own brief. **Affects:** `backend/app/
policy/` and its tests only; does not touch `shared/`, and the Policy Engine
package itself imports nothing from `backend/app/models/` (verified by the
same import-boundary test).

**2026-08-31 — Varun P. (via `vp/schema-and-policy-engine`)** — Wrote the
persistence layer: SQLAlchemy models for every table in docs/lanes/vp.md's
schema (`backend/app/models/`), one Alembic migration
(`backend/alembic/versions/0001_initial_schema.py`, verified to apply
cleanly to an empty database and downgrade back to empty — against SQLite,
since no Postgres service exists in CI or is guaranteed on every
contributor's machine; see ADR-0013), and a deterministic seed script
(`backend/app/seed.py`, `make db-reset`) telling the same three-agent story
`app/fixtures/` already tells, using the *same* ids so a later switch from
fixture-stubbed responses to real persistence changes nothing the frontend
sees. `agents.current_limit`/`current_rung` is protected two ways: a
`CheckConstraint` generated from `shared.constants.AUTONOMY_LADDER`
(`ck_agents_rung_matches_limit`, rejects any pair not on the real ladder) and
a `before_flush` session hook (`app/models/guards.py`) that refuses to flush
an agent whose limit changed without a paired `policy_versions` row in the
same transaction — `apply_policy_version()` is the one sanctioned way to
change both together. The same hook makes `policy_versions` and `audit_log`
append-only (raises on any UPDATE or DELETE attempt) rather than relying on
nobody writing one. The hash-chain helper (`app/models/audit_hash.py`:
`sha256(prev_hash + canonical_json(payload))`) reuses the exact algorithm
`app/fixtures/audit.py` had already hand-rolled, with its own test suite
proving determinism and tamper-evidence independent of any caller — ingest
wiring (appending an entry on every mutating request) is separate work.
Wrote ADR-0013 for JSONB over normalised storage on the two evidence-snapshot
columns (`trust_evaluations.payload`, `recommendations.agent_opinions`).
**Why:** Fri 28 Aug deliverable (docs/DEADLINES.md: "`make db-reset` produces
a seeded DB"), already slipped into this weekend. **Affects:** `backend/
app/models/`, `backend/alembic/`, `backend/app/seed.py`, `backend/
pyproject.toml` (added `sqlalchemy`, `alembic`, `psycopg2-binary`,
`hypothesis`). Does not touch `shared/`, and does not wire any API endpoint
to the database — the stubs in `backend/app/api/v1/` are untouched; that is
Mon 31 Aug / Thu 3 Sept work.

---

**2026-08-27 — Varun P. (via `vp/openapi-contract`)** — Published the complete
backend HTTP contract: `backend/app/main.py`, all eighteen endpoints stubbed
against internally-consistent fixtures (three agents — one mid-ladder and
eligible for an increase, one on probation with a small sample, one clawed
back after confirmed drift), `export_openapi.py`, `backend/openapi.json`
committed. Every response model mirroring a `shared/contracts.py` dataclass
(`DecisionRecord`, `TrustEvaluation`, `DriftResult`, `ProportionResult`,
`ScoreComponent`, `Recommendation`, `AgentOpinion`, `AuditSample`,
`AgentContext`) does so field-for-field, enforced by a generalized
contract-drift test (`backend/tests/test_schema_contracts.py`) rather than
nine hand-written ones. Wrote ADR-0011 for the two decisions made once and
applied everywhere: the `items`/`total`/`page`/`page_size` pagination
envelope, and a mandatory `reason` on every mutating endpoint, including the
two (`POST /decisions`, `POST /simulation/runs`) that don't look like
governance decisions at first glance. No database models, migrations, or
SQLAlchemy anywhere in this branch — persistence is separate work
(docs/DEADLINES.md: Fri 28 Aug onward). **Why:** Tue 25 Aug deliverable,
already two days late (docs/audits/2026-08-27-delta-audit.md); the frontend
lane has been blocked on this file since 21 Aug. **Affects:** `backend/`
only. Also fixed the dev environment while touching it: `make setup` /
`scripts/setup.ps1` now install all four Python lanes (trust, simulator,
governance, backend) editable unconditionally — the old conditional
"install if it exists" logic was written when backend/governance were
empty and silently left simulator out entirely; `make test` runs pytest
across all four; `docs/ONBOARDING.md` updated to match, since "install only
`trust[dev]`" left simulator and governance tests failing on import with no
obvious cause for anyone following it literally.

**2026-08-27 — Varun (via `docs/resurrect-pr5`)** — Re-applied PR #5's commit
(`6a77eed`, "transplant Wilson table, ADR defend-it lines, layer walkthrough
into SYSTEM-EXPLAINED.md"), cherry-picked cleanly onto `main` as `7a169f6`.
**Why:** PR #5 was opened with base `docs/reset-and-reschedule` instead of
`main`. PR #4 (`docs/reset-and-reschedule` → `main`) merged at
2026-08-23T13:15:55Z; PR #5 merged its commit into `docs/reset-and-reschedule`
32 seconds later, at 13:16:27Z — by which point that branch had already done
its one job and nobody opened a follow-up PR to carry the new commit into
`main`. GitHub shows PR #5 as `MERGED`, and it was, into a branch that never
reached `main` — `origin/docs/reset-and-reschedule` still exists, still
sitting at that commit, four days later. Content was verified missing
(`git merge-base --is-ancestor 6a77eed origin/main` → false) and restorable
without conflict (`main`'s `docs/SYSTEM-EXPLAINED.md` was still byte-identical
to `6a77eed`'s parent, so nothing on `main` needed reconciling). **Affects:**
`docs/SYSTEM-EXPLAINED.md` only — the Wilson lower-bound numbers table, a
"Defend it" line on all 10 ADRs, and the plain/technical layer-by-layer
walkthrough are back; verified in `docs/audits/2026-08-27-delta-audit.md` §1
and the PR that carries this entry. `docs/RISKS.md`/`docs/CONTEXT.md`'s own
staleness (unrelated to this gap) is not addressed here.

**2026-08-24 — Varun C. (via `vc/langgraph-skeleton`)** — Set governance's
default mode to `stub`, not `cached`. `resolve_mode()` raises `ValueError` on
an unrecognised mode rather than falling back. **Why:** an unset
`GOVERNANCE_MODE` must never reach for a fixture directory that does not exist
yet, and must never be one typo away from a live API call. A mode that
silently degraded to stub would look like a working demo while proving
nothing. **Affects:** anything invoking `governance.recommend()`; `cached`
becomes the demo default explicitly, at the call site, once it exists (30 Aug).

**2026-08-24 — Varun C. (via `vc/langgraph-skeleton`)** — `Recommendation.
trust_evaluation_ref` is supplied by the caller, not generated in governance.
**Why:** `TrustEvaluation` carries no identity field, and the backend is the
only component that persists both sides; minting an id here would produce a
reference pointing at nothing. **Affects:** `vp/backend` — the backend must
pass its own evaluation id into `recommend()`. **Needs Varun P.'s
confirmation**, as it changes the call signature he builds against.

**2026-08-24 — Varun C. (via `vc/langgraph-skeleton`)** — Governance's audit
agent detects unruled escalations and critical-error clustering, but *not* the
per-vendor or time-windowed anomalies described in `docs/lanes/vc.md`.
**Why:** those need `DecisionRecord` history; `TrustEvaluation` carries only
aggregates. Widening the input is a cross-lane contract change and `shared/`
is frozen until 9 Sept (ADR-0005). **Affects:** scope of the audit agent;
revisit via ADR if the wider input is wanted.

**2026-08-23 — Varun (via `docs/reset-and-reschedule`)** — Named Utkarsh
backup reviewer: if Varun P. is unavailable, Utkarsh can approve and merge
anything that doesn't touch `shared/` (which still needs all four owners).
**Why:** Varun P. has interview commitments 24 Aug - 3 Sept and the team
cannot afford a lane sitting blocked on review during that window (RISKS.md
R12). **Affects:** the review process for every lane but `shared/` itself;
documented in `docs/DEADLINES.md` and `docs/lanes/uk.md`.

**2026-08-23 — Varun (via `docs/reset-and-reschedule`)** — Deleted
`infra/grafana/.gitkeep` and `infra/prometheus/.gitkeep`, and the now-empty
`infra/grafana/` and `infra/prometheus/` directories. **Why:** dead scaffold
left over from the 17 Aug initial commit for an observability stack
`docker-compose.yml` already explicitly states is cut from scope ("No Redis,
no Celery, no observability stack (Prometheus/Grafana)"). Flagged in
`docs/audits/2026-08-23-state-audit.md` §4. **Affects:** `infra/` only;
nothing referenced either directory.

**2026-08-23 — Varun (via `docs/reset-and-reschedule`)** — Committed
`docs/DEADLINES.md`, `docs/ONBOARDING.md`, `docs/SYSTEM-EXPLAINED.md`, and
`docs/lanes/{ad,uk,vc,vp}.md` to `main` for the first time. **Why:** all of
these existed only outside git before today. That is the direct, named root
cause (RISKS.md R11, ADR-0010) of ~35,600 lines being built on
`origin/ad/simulator-frontend` against an invented `shared/`, because nobody
who cloned the 17 Aug scaffold could discover the real one existed. A
document that isn't in the repository doesn't exist as far as a fresh clone —
or a fresh clone's AI assistant — is concerned. **Affects:** every lane;
`docs/ONBOARDING.md` now tells anyone joining, or anyone whose local branch
predates 23 Aug, exactly how to catch up.

**2026-08-23 — Varun (via `docs/reset-and-reschedule`)** — Merged the
stranded `origin/docs/audit-and-risk-fix` branch (the RISKS.md three-week
timeline correction and the 2026-08-21 pre-merge audit file), 2 days after it
became mergeable. **Why:** it was clean and conflict-free the entire time —
there was no technical reason for it to sit unmerged; it was simply never
picked up. **Affects:** `docs/RISKS.md`, adds
`docs/audits/2026-08-21-pre-merge-audit.md`.

**2026-08-23 — Varun (via `docs/reset-and-reschedule`)** — Wrote ADR-0010:
`main`'s frozen v1.1 `shared/` contracts are canonical; the divergent design
independently built on `origin/ad/simulator-frontend` is partially ported
(estimated 7-9 person-days per `docs/audits/2026-08-23-port-feasibility.md`),
not merged as-is and not discarded. Submission moved **12 September → 15
September 2026**; feature freeze moved **6 September → 9 September 2026**,
giving the port three extra days of runway it would not otherwise have had.
**Why:** two incompatible definitions of the core domain cannot coexist in a
system whose entire premise is a single auditable source of truth (ADR-0005);
discarding ~5,900 lines of real, working, port-feasible code costs more
(10-13 person-days) than fixing its foundation (7-9). **Affects:** `shared/`,
`simulator/`, `frontend/`; every date in `docs/DEADLINES.md` and
`docs/lanes/*.md`; see ADR-0010 for full reasoning, `docs/RISKS.md` R9 for
the risk this closes down to a scoped, owned, dated piece of work.

---

**2026-08-21 — Varun (via `chore/infra-baseline`)** — Filled in every 0-byte
root-level placeholder: `docker-compose.yml` (postgres:16 + adminer, no
Redis/Celery/observability), `.env.example`, `Makefile`
(setup/up/down/db-reset/test/test-trust/openapi/lint/fmt/dev/frontend, all
skipping gracefully when a lane has no code yet), `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
(same skip-gracefully philosophy, plus an `openapi.json` staleness check),
`.gitattributes`, `README.md`, and `scripts/*.ps1` for teammates without GNU
make. Also fixed 19 pre-existing ruff findings in `trust/` (mechanical only —
import order, `range(0, n)`, one NaN-check inconsistency between two
near-identical `_clamp01` helpers; deliberately did not run `ruff format`,
which would have restyled the author's test-constructor style far beyond
what the findings needed) so the new CI lint step doesn't fail on day one.
**Why:** nothing in the repo ran end to end before this — `docs/DEADLINES.md`
needs a working `make setup && make up` for Phase 2 to start. **Affects:**
every lane; `make setup`/`make test-trust` verified working on this machine
(after fixing a Windows backslash-path bug the first run caught); `make
up`/`down` could not be verified here — no Docker installed on this machine.

**2026-08-21 — Varun (via `shared/v1-1-recommendation-and-audit-sample`)** —
Shipped `shared/` v1.1 (`SCHEMA_VERSION` "1.0" → "1.1"), the Phase 1 deliverable
from `docs/DEADLINES.md`: added `Recommendation` + `AgentOpinion` (governance's
output contract, mirroring `TrustEvaluation`'s role for the trust lane) and
`AuditSample` (the rung-scaled post-hoc review mechanism, ADR-0009) to
`shared/contracts.py`; `RecommendationStatus`, `OpinionVerdict`, `ReviewVerdict`
to `shared/enums.py` (uppercase values, with a comment flagging — not fixing —
`AgentState`'s pre-existing lowercase inconsistency); `SAMPLING_RATE_BY_RUNG`,
`MIN_SAMPLES_FOR_ACCURACY_ESTIMATE`, `sampling_rate_of()` to
`shared/constants.py`; `SAMPLE_EVIDENCE_INSUFFICIENT`, `SAMPLE_REVIEW_DISAGREEMENT`,
`RECOMMENDATION_CLAMPED` to `shared/reason_codes.py`. Documented, as docstrings
on `TrustEvaluation`, the two ambiguities `AUDIT.md` flagged: the
`eligible_for_increase`/`direction` relationship and the
`current_limit`/`current_rung` invariant. Purely additive — no existing field or
type changed; a short list of contract gaps this surfaced (notably: no field
distinguishing ground-truth-derived vs. sample-derived accuracy on
`TrustEvaluation`) was handed back for a decision rather than added to the diff.
**Why:** `docs/DEADLINES.md` requires `shared/` to freeze at this merge with all
four lane owners' approval, and everything downstream of it (governance's
recommendation output, the backend's review queue, the trust engine's
production ground-truth source) is blocked on this contract existing first.
**Affects:** all four lanes — this is the last `shared/` change permitted
before the 6 September feature freeze per the standing rules in
`docs/DEADLINES.md`.

**2026-08-21 — Varun (via `chore/rename-and-docs`)** — Merged
`origin/uk/shared-trust-contracts` and `origin/uk/trust` into
`chore/rename-and-docs` before doing any rename/documentation work, since
those are the only two branches with real content and the trust engine cannot
be discussed, cited, or edited without them. **Why:** the repo-wide rename and
documentation bootstrap referenced files (`trust/pyproject.toml`,
`trust/trust_engine/`) that only exist on `origin/uk/trust`, and that branch
only imports cleanly once `shared/contracts.py` is populated from
`origin/uk/shared-trust-contracts`. **Affects:** this branch now has a working
trust engine + populated `shared/`; `main` itself still does not — that merge
is a separate, still-pending step (see Risk R2 in `docs/RISKS.md`).

**2026-08-21 — Varun** — Commissioned a full pre-merge audit of `uk/trust`
(`AUDIT.md`). Found the branch unmergeable as committed: its copy of
`shared/contracts.py` was still the empty placeholder, because `uk/trust` and
`uk/shared-trust-contracts` diverged independently from the same base commit
and neither was ever merged into the other. Also found the autonomy
ladder/cooldown/clawback logic — half of `uk/trust`'s ownership brief — is
entirely unimplemented (constants defined, nothing reads them), and that no
function anywhere produces the `TrustEvaluation` contract type. **Why:**
pre-merge gate before any lane starts integrating against `uk/trust`.
**Affects:** merge order and the fix checklist for `uk/trust`; directly
motivated the merge above.

**2026-08-20 15:57 (`70b3b96`) — Utkarsh Sahgal** — Pushed `origin/uk/trust`:
Wilson score interval, rate/proportion calculations (accuracy, utilization,
human agreement), two-stage drift detection, trust-score composition, and a
113-test suite. **Why:** `uk/trust`'s ownership brief — the statistical
evidence engine. **Affects:** `trust/` package. Notably does *not* implement
the autonomy ladder or cooldowns despite `trust/trust_engine/constants.py`
already defining their thresholds.

**2026-08-19 17:06 (`5721b1e`) — Utkarsh Sahgal** — Removed placeholder
`.gitkeep` files in `trust/`, replaced by real package contents. **Affects:**
`trust/` directory structure only.

**2026-08-19 17:03:58 (`f606d6a`) — Utkarsh Sahgal** — Added `trust/pyproject.toml`,
package `__init__.py` files, and `DecisionRecord` contract tests. Branched
from `main`, **not** from `uk/shared-trust-contracts` (pushed by the same
author two minutes earlier) — this is the root cause of the later divergence
resolved on 2026-08-21 above. **Affects:** `trust/` package skeleton.

**2026-08-19 17:02:09 (`444fdc0`) — Utkarsh Sahgal** — Pushed
`origin/uk/shared-trust-contracts`: populated `shared/enums.py`,
`constants.py`, `reason_codes.py`, and `contracts.py` — the cross-lane treaty
files, including `TrustEvaluation`, `DecisionRecord`, `AgentContext`,
`DriftResult`, `ProportionResult`, `ScoreComponent`. **Why:** give all four
lanes a common contract to build against (ADR-0005). **Affects:** every lane,
in principle — as of 2026-08-21, only this branch (`chore/rename-and-docs`)
and its own origin branch actually have it; `main` and the other three lane
branches do not yet.

**2026-08-17 23:56:58 (`c126543`) — Varun** — "chore: initialize project
structure": created the four-lane directory skeleton (`backend/`, `trust/`,
`governance/`, `simulator/`, `frontend/`, `shared/`, `infra/`) as empty
placeholder files (`.gitkeep`, empty `__init__.py`, 0-byte config files).
**Why:** establish the four-owner branch structure for the capstone.
**Affects:** baseline for every subsequent lane branch (`vp/backend`,
`uk/trust`, `vc/governance`, `ad/simulator-frontend` all still point at this
exact commit as of 2026-08-21, except `uk/trust`'s origin, per above).
