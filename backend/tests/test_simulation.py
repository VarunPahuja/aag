    *same* agent. `generate_decision_plan` is seeded by
    `(agent_id, phase, seed)` deliberately (see its docstring) precisely so
    that two *different* agents given the same numeric seed do NOT collide —
    determinism is a property of repeating the exact same run, not of the
    bare seed value alone.

    seed=99 used to work here, but since vp/clawback-trigger it happens to
    put a critical error in run A's last `CRITICAL_ERROR_WINDOW` decisions —
    run A then claws back agent-01 (correctly; see
    test_simulation_clawback.py), which changes `agent.current_limit`
    *before* run B's own plan is generated. `generate_decision_plan` takes
    `current_limit` as an explicit argument specifically because it sets the
    invoice-amount range (see its own docstring) — a different limit is a
    different amount range, which perturbs every draw after it from the same
    seeded `random.Random` stream, and run B stops matching run A. That is
    not a determinism bug in `generate_decision_plan` itself (each run is
    still exactly reproducible given its own inputs) — it is this test's
    premise ("two back-to-back same-seed runs see the same current_limit")
    no longer holding for every seed, now that a run can change the very
    limit the next one's plan depends on. seed=1 has no critical error
    anywhere in a 15-decision degraded plan for agent-01 (checked directly
    against `generate_decision_plan`), so neither run claws back and the
    premise holds again.

    One update since PR #47 wrote the paragraph above: the plan now escalates
    any invoice over `current_limit`, so a 15-decision run leaves only five to
    eight *acted* decisions — and `CRITICAL_ERROR_WINDOW` counts acted
    decisions only. Checked directly against `generate_decision_plan`: neither
    phase at either seed now puts a critical error in that window, so the safe
    set is wider than it was. The reasoning is unchanged and seed=1 is kept;
    only the claim that seed=99 specifically breaks it no longer holds.
