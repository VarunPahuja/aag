"""The FastAPI app. Every other lane talks through this (docs/lanes/vp.md,
responsibility 3: "The HTTP contract").

No database, no policy engine logic, no SQLAlchemy anywhere in this module
or anything it imports — this branch ships the contract with every
endpoint stubbed against canned fixtures (docs/DEADLINES.md, Tue 25 Aug).
Persistence lands separately (Fri 28 Aug onward).

# checkout needs no configuration. No credentials/cookies are used — auth is
# a header, not a cookie (app/deps.py) — so naming exact origins rather than
# "*" costs nothing and keeps the check meaningful.
