"""Generating a governance `Recommendation` for an agent, and reading one back.

`generate_recommendation` is the request-path glue: fresh trust evidence in,
a clamped, persisted `Recommendation` out, in one transaction — trust engine,
governance panel, and the Policy Engine's hard ceiling, wired together
exactly once (docs/lanes/vp.md, ADR-0001, ADR-0003, ADR-0004, ADR-0014).

`recommendation_out` is the read side, shared with
`app/api/v1/recommendations.py` so a row read straight back from the database
and the row this module just persisted always turn into the same API shape.
