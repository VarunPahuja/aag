    ground truth. ADR-0009 describes reviewed samples eventually *becoming*
    the ground-truth source once the system runs past the simulator, but that
    same ADR flags the contract gap it depends on — `TrustEvaluation` has no
    field distinguishing accuracy built from full ground truth from accuracy
    built from a sampled slice — as deferred, not decided. Silently
    substituting one for the other here would corrupt the simulator's
    deterministic ground truth and break the arc's reproducibility, to
