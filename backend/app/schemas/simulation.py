"""Simulation-run response and request models.

No `shared/` equivalent — `simulator/simulator/models.py`'s
`SimulationRunConfig`/`SimulationRunResult` are simulator-local, not
treaty types, so this is a backend-local resource that records *that* a
run happened and summarizes its outcome, not the simulator's own internal
shape. Endpoint check (docs/lanes/vp.md): the simulator posts a decision,
the backend persists it — starting a run and reading its status back is
the operational surface around that, not a mirror of anything in
`shared/`.
