"""SQLAlchemy models for every table in docs/lanes/vp.md's schema.

Import this package (or `app.models.base.Base`) to get `Base.metadata`
populated with every table — Alembic's `env.py` and `Base.metadata.create_all`
in tests both rely on that. `app.models.guards` is imported for its side
effect (registering the `before_flush` append-only / paired-limit-change hook
on every `Session`) — see that module's docstring. Its own imports reach
`Agent`/`PolicyVersion`/`AuditLogEntry` directly by submodule path, so it
registers correctly regardless of where this line sits relative to the
others below (ruff's import sort places it first, alphabetically).
